## About

At Stackmate, we build software to enable self-sovereignty. We are and will always only ever be managed by Bitcoin remnants.

Our software is free from VC, fiat or shitcoin influences and we actively work to ward off such attempts.

All our software is FOSS. Feel free to do as you please with it.

Before forking, we urge you to start a conversation with us and contribute, no matter how blunt your message, express it freely.

## Goals

We aim to achieve:

1. Simplicity
2. Security
3. Speed

Prioritized in that order.

## Core

This app uses [stackmate-core](https://github.com/i5hi/stackmate-core) for it's Bitcoin specific logic.
<br/>
[stackmate-core](https://github.com/i5hi/stackmate-core) is built using Rust.
<br/>
This app communicates with [stackmate-core's](https://github.com/i5hi/stackmate-core) Rust binary via FFI.

## Features

- **modern descriptor wallets:** uses all the latest technologies from the Bitcoin ecosystem
